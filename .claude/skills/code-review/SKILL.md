# Code Review

> Comprehensive AI-powered code review for PRs and local changes — enterprise-grade alternative to CodeRabbit

## When to use

- "code review"
- "review my PR"
- "review PR #123"
- "check my changes"
- "what's wrong with my code"
- "security review"
- "full review"
- "/review"
- "/review-pr"

## Dependencies

- External: `gh` CLI (GitHub), `git`

## Modes

### 1. Local review (uncommitted changes)
Reviews `git diff` — changes not yet committed.

### 2. Branch review (vs main/master)
Reviews all changes in current branch compared to main.

### 3. PR review (GitHub)
Fetches diff from GitHub PR and can post comments.

### 4. Focused review
User can request specific focus: security, performance, bugs, style, etc.

---

## How to execute

### Step 0: Check if review needed

**Skip review if:**
- PR is draft (`gh pr view --json isDraft`)
- PR is already closed/merged
- Only documentation changes (.md, .txt, LICENSE)
- Only config changes (.json, .yaml, .toml) without code impact
- Trivial changes (<5 lines, whitespace only, version bumps)

**Inform user and ask to confirm if they still want review.**

---

### Step 1: Determine mode

Ask user or detect automatically:
- If PR number provided → PR review
- If uncommitted changes exist → local review
- If on feature branch → branch review
- If specific focus requested → apply focus filter

### Step 2: Get diff

**Local:**
```bash
git diff HEAD
```

**Branch (vs main):**
```bash
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo "main")
git diff $DEFAULT_BRANCH...HEAD
```

**PR:**
```bash
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>
```

### Step 3: Get context

For thorough review, read related files:
```bash
# List changed files
git diff --name-only HEAD

# Read each file fully for context
# Check package.json for dependencies
# Check tsconfig/eslint config for project standards
```

### Step 3b: Filter pre-existing issues

Before reporting an issue, check if it was introduced in this PR:

```bash
# Check when the problematic line was last modified
git blame -L <start>,<end> <file> --porcelain | head -1
```

**Skip issues that:**
- Existed before this PR (old blame hash)
- Are in unchanged lines
- Were introduced by a different author long ago

**Only report issues introduced or modified in current changes.**

This prevents noise from legacy code and focuses review on new changes.

---

### Step 4: Comprehensive Analysis

Apply ALL relevant checks from the checklist below.

### Step 5: Confidence Scoring

**Rate each issue 0-100:**

| Score | Confidence | When to use |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 90-100 | Certain | Clear vulnerability (SQL injection with user input), obvious crash |
| 70-89 | High | Likely bug, security risk, definite code smell |
| 50-69 | Medium | Potential issue, needs context to confirm |
| 25-49 | Low | Style preference, minor suggestion |
| 0-24 | Skip | Probably false positive, pre-existing, or nitpick |

**Only report issues with confidence ≥70.**

**Mark as false positive and skip:**
- Pre-existing issues (caught by Step 3b)
- Issues that linters will catch (eslint, prettier)
- Pedantic nitpicks without real impact
- Code that looks wrong but has valid reason (check comments)
- Issues with explicit ignore comments (`// eslint-disable`, `# noqa`)

---

### Step 6: Output result

**Format:**
```markdown
## Code Review Summary

**Reviewed:** X files, Y lines changed
**Risk Level:** Critical / High / Medium / Low

### Critical Issues (must fix)
- [file:line] Description — Why it matters

### High Priority
- [file:line] Description

### Medium Priority
- [file:line] Description

### Low Priority / Suggestions
- [file:line] Description

### Good Practices
- What was done well
```

**For GitHub PR — post comments:**
```bash
# General comment on PR
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "## AI Code Review
[Review content]"

# Line-by-line comments via API (for specific file/line feedback)
# Replace {owner}, {repo}, {pr} with actual values
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments \
  --method POST \
  -f body="Issue description and fix suggestion" \
  -f path="src/file.ts" \
  -f line=42 \
  -f side="RIGHT"
```

---

## Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Must fix before merge. Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks | SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, auth bypass |
| **High** | Should fix before merge. Significant bugs or security issues | N+1 queries, XSS, missing error handling |
| **Medium** | Fix soon. Code quality, minor bugs | DRY violations, missing tests, complexity |
| **Low** | Nice to have. Suggestions, style | Naming, comments, minor optimizations |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `gh: command not found` | `brew install gh && gh auth login` |
| No diff output | Check if changes exist: `git status` |
| PR not found | Check PR number and access rights |
| Can't post comments | Check permissions: `gh auth status` |
| Review too long | Use `--focus` to narrow scope |
| False positives | Mention specific context to skip |

---

## Limitations

- Static analysis only — cannot run code
- Cannot see runtime behavior
- May miss complex cross-file issues
- Needs context for architectural decisions
- GitHub API rate limits when posting many comments
- Language-specific checks may vary in depth

---

## If you're getting false positives

### Step 1: Use severity filter

Most false positives are low/medium severity. Start with high-only:

```text
"review PR 123 --severity=high"
"review my changes, only critical and high issues"
```

### Step 2: Use focus filter

Narrow to specific categories you care about:

```text
"security review PR 123"
"review PR 123 --focus=bugs,security"
"check only performance issues"
```

### Step 3: Tell Claude to skip specific issues

In the same conversation, provide context:

```text
"ignore the N+1 warning in admin routes - it's intentional, low traffic"
"skip any type warnings in src/legacy/ - that's legacy code"
"the raw SQL in migrations/ is fine, we use raw migrations"
```

### Step 4: Add inline comment in code

For persistent false positives that keep appearing:

```typescript
// @review-ok: parameterized query handled by ORM
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${sanitizedId}`;
```

```python
# @review-ok: global cache intentional for performance
CACHE = {}
```

### Step 5: Report to improve the skill

If the same false positive keeps appearing across reviews:

1. Open issue at [github.com/anthroos/claude-code-review-skill/issues](https://github.com/anthroos/claude-code-review-skill/issues)
2. Include:
   - File and line number
   - What was flagged
   - Why it's a false positive
   - Code snippet if possible

This helps improve the skill for everyone.

---

## Default behavior

The skill is designed to minimize false positives out of the box:

- **Baseline filtering** — Only reports issues introduced in current PR/changes (via git blame)
- **Confidence threshold** — Only reports issues with ≥70% confidence
- **Skips linter territory** — Doesn't flag formatting, style issues that ESLint/Prettier catch
- **Skips pre-existing issues** — Won't complain about old code you didn't touch
- **Skips trivial changes** — Version bumps, whitespace, documentation-only changes
